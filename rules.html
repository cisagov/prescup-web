                        <ol>
                            <li>Violation of the Rules of Conduct as outlined may result in disqualification from
                                the
                                competition.</li>
                            <li>Enforcement of the Rules of Conduct is at the discretion of the Competition Staff.
                            </li>
                            <li>Competitors will conduct themselves in a manner that befits employees of the Federal
                                government and members of the Uniformed Services in all aspects of the competition.</li>
                            <li>When choosing team and individual names, competitors will follow OPSEC best practices
                                and not use real names, work location, or other identifying information. Competitors
                                will also refrain from any names that are vulgar or political in nature (In accordance
                                with the Hatch Act). Names will go through an approval process before appearing on the
                                leaderboard. Inappropriate language, references to political persons or parties, or
                                otherwise inappropriate content will be asked to be changed. The competition aims to
                                support morale building, esprit de corps, and friendly rivalries between military units,
                                and government departments and agencies. The competition staff reserves the right to ask
                                any team or individual to change their name and retains final judgement on what is
                                acceptable.</li>
                            <li>Classified toolsets are not authorized for use. All challenges are designed to be
                                solved using open source tools including those provided on the hosted virtual machines.
                            </li>
                            <li>Any attempts at unauthorized access or “Denial of Service” attacks are forbidden and
                                will result in disqualification. “Escaping” the virtual machines or otherwise
                                tampering
                                with or targeting the hosting environment is prohibited.</li>
