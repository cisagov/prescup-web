    <strong> 0. What does "Cumulative Time" mean on the leaderboard?</strong>

The <strong>Cumulative Time</strong> column is only used for tiebreaking purposes. When a challenge is started, a timer tracks how long it takes to solve that challenge. The sum time of all successfully solved challenges is posted to the leaderboard under Cumulative Time. Again, this is for tiebreaking purposes only.
</div>

<div class="card" id="q1">
    <strong> 1. I’m a government contractor and I want to participate. Am I eligible?</strong>
No. Government contractors cannot participate in the President's Cup.
</div>

<div class="card" id="q2">
    <strong> 2. Will I need any special software or applications to participate in the President’s Cup?</strong>
No. All that is needed for the first two qualification rounds is a modern web browser and your registered account. Supported browsers are: Chrome, Firefox and Edge or later.
</div>

<div class="card" id="q3">
  <strong> 3. How does each round’s continuous eight-hour session work?</strong>

A session timer starts when you launch your first challenge. After launching that challenge, your team will have eight hours to complete as many challenges as you can. The session timer runs continuously and cannot be paused. Your round score is determined by the sum of all successful challenges completed during your session. For more information, watch the 8-hour continuous session video on the <a href="home/doc/Home">Home page</a>.

<strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> In 2020, each Individual track will be limited to 4 hours per track.
</div>

<div class="card" id="q4">
  <strong> 4. Does my score carry over from one round to the next?</strong>

No. The score for each round starts at zero.
</div>

<div class="card" id="q5">
  <strong> 5. How are ties handled?</strong>

In the event of a tiebreaker, the "Cumulative Time" figure will be used to determine who moves on to the Final Round. The Cumulative Time is the total time spent in challenges successfully solved. This is calculated using a timer specific to each challenge on your game board. When you start a challenge, the timer starts. When you successfully solve a challenge, your score and cumulative time are updated. 

<strong>Please note:</strong> 

- Your challenge timer does not stop if you "delete" a challenge space or go work on another challenge. If you start a challenge, then start and work on another challenge, and return to your previous challenge, your challenge timer is still running.
- Time spent in challenges failed, or challenges started and not finished, does not count towards your cumulative score. You won't be penalized for trying!
- Your overall competition time is still capped at eight (8) hours from when you launch your first challenge.
  </div>

<div class="card" id="q6">
    <strong> 6. I saw that the Championship Round is an in-person, three-day event. Where is the Championship Round held?</strong>

<div class="card" id="q8">
    <strong> 8. My agency wants to enter two teams in Round 1. Is that possible?</strong>
Yes. A department or agency can enter more than one team in the competition.
</div>

<div class="card" id="q9">
    <strong> 9. One of my team members dropped out after Round 1. Can I replace them with someone else for Round 2?</strong>
No. Once a team is established, members cannot be added. You have the option to compete without that team member.
</div>

<div class="card" id="q11">
    <strong> 11. You mention that the competition challenges will be mapped to the NICE Framework. Where can I get more information on the NICE Framework?</strong>

This [one-page overview](https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017/06/13/nice_framework062017.pdf) is a good place to start. This video, [NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework 101](https://www.nist.gov/nice-tutorials#NICE%20Cybersecurity%20Workforce%20Framework%20101), is a more detailed introduction to the NICE Framework website.
</div>

<div class="card" id="q12">
    <strong> 12. I’m eligible to participate in the President’s Cup, but I don’t have a team. Can I participate as an individual?</strong>

Yes. Participants can compete either as part of a team or as an individual or both. Round 1 is open to any and all Federal Executive Branch cybersecurity professionals.
</div>

<div class="card" id="q13">
    <strong> 13. I’m a detailee and I want to participate. Which organization do I participate with – my original agency or my detailed agency?</strong>

Detailees to a specific agency can participate on a team for their detailed agency or their home agency.
</div>
<div class="card" id="q14">
    <strong> 14. Can I participate on more than one team at a time?</strong>

No. You can only be a team member on one team.
</div>
<div class="card" id="q15">
    <strong> 15. What if I can't access my email when I'm out of the office?</strong>

To use multi-factor authentication without access to email, visit your identity profile at <a href="https://id.presidentscup.us/ui/profile">id.presidentscup.us/ui/profile</a> and <em>Configure 2FA</em>. You'll need to be logged in for this, so be sure to do this while you do have access to email.

There you can generate a Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) secret key.  Use this secret key with any totp-enabled authentication app, such as Duo Mobile or Google Authenticator, by simply scanning the barcode.  If you don't have access to your device, copy down the secret key and later input it into the totp app on your device.
</div>

<div class="card" id="q16">
    <strong> 16. Can I copy/paste between my host and the gamespace virtual machines?</strong>
Yes. The cog button in the upper-left corner of the virtual machine console allows you to move text bidirectionally between your host and that virtual machine.
</div>

<div class="card" id="q17">
    <strong> 17. If I reach my limit of virtual gamespaces (5 for teams, 2 for individuals), can I move on to another challenge?</strong>

Yes. If you start a challenge but would like to move on to another challenge without finishing it, you can **DELETE** that gamespace. However, the challenge timer will not stop.

When you return to this challenge, you can **RESTART** the gamespace in it's original state.
</div>

<div class="card" id="q18">
    <strong> 18. Is there a recommended format for answer submissions?</strong>
Correct asnwers will vary based on the challenge format and the questions being asked. Please refer to each challenge description which will clearly articulate the format of the answer.
</div>

<div class="card" id="q19">
    <strong> 19. President’s Cup Support is asking for my “challenge Support Code”. Where can I find it?</strong>
The challenge Support Code can be found in the lower-right corner of the challenge pane. The Support Code looks similar to this: **a347c5c6**.
</div>

<div class="card" id="q20">
    <strong> 20. How are teams selected to advance to Round 2?</strong>

In the Teams competition, the top-scoring team from each competing Department automatically advances to Round 2. For the purposes of the competition, Departments align with the organizations listed during enrollment.

For those not included as top Department teams, the top 20% of remaining teams based on their final scores advance to Round 2 as well. No time-based tiebreakers are used to calculate the 20% cutoff, so all teams tied at the score cutoff will advance.
</div>

<div class="card" id="q21">
    <strong> 21. How are individuals selected to advance to Round 2?</strong>
In the Individuals competition, the top 100 scores advance to Round 2. There are no tie-breakers; all tied for 100th place will be invited to continue. Round 1 leaderboard scores are used to determine the cutoff line, and no time-based tiebreakers are used in this calculation.
</div>


<div class="card" id="q22">
    <strong> 22. How are teams and individuals selected to advance to the Final Round?</strong>

The final rounds for the President's Cup team and individual competitions will be held on different days. Competitors who qualify for both final round events will be able to compete in each one without a conflict. Furthermore, each Individual Track final will take place at different times, allowing for someone to paritcipate in both if they should qualify.
</div>

<div class="card" id="q24">
    <strong> 24. I heard there will be multi-part challenges. How will that work?</strong>
This year, we've implemented multi-part challenges to reward competitiors for their efforts towards solving the challenge. For multi-part challenges, you will be presented with multiple questions and multiple solution submission boxes in the Challenge. These challenges are designed to test your knowledge across the width of a challenge; for instance, you may be asked to provide multiple identifiers from a packet capture file, each as its own solution. Each question will clearly identify what type of solution and the proper format to submit. <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> When you press submit, ALL of your solutions will be sent to the grading server, and you will be limited to THREE (3) submissions per challenge.
