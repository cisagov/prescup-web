                                <p class="question">What does "Cumulative Time" mean on the leaderboard?</p>
                                <p>The <strong>Cumulative Time</strong> column is only used for tiebreaking
                                    purposes.
                                    When a challenge is started, a timer tracks how long it takes to solve that
                                    challenge. The
                                    sum time of all successfully solved challenges is posted to the leaderboard
                                    under
                                    Cumulative Time. Again, this is for tiebreaking purposes only.</p>

                                <p>No. All that is needed is an up-to-date web

                                <p>A session timer starts when you click the "Start Session" button on a Gameboard's
                                    welcome page. After starting the session, you/your team will have a limited amount

                                    challenges as you can.</p>

                                    who moves on to the Final Round. The Cumulative Time is the total time spent in
                                    challenges successfully solved. This is calculated using a timer specific to
                                    each
                                    challenge on your game board. When you start a challenge, the timer starts. When
                                    you
                                    successfully solve a challenge, your score and cumulative time are updated.</p>
