                                <p>Beginning with President’s Cup 7 (PC7), the President’s Cup team will institute a formalized cap on repeat winners to ensure fairness, encourage new talent recognition, and sustain community engagement.</p> 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The eligibility cap will be applied to competitors (whether as individuals or as part of a team) that achieve three top 3 placements with at least one first-place finish across all future competition years and tracks beginning with PC7.</li>
                                    <li>The top 3 placements may be consecutive or non-consecutive to apply, and multiple top 3 finishes within a single year (e.g., in both an Individuals track and as part of a team) will count as a single placement year toward the cap.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Competitors who achieve three top 3 placements with at least one first-place finish in any track throughout the history of the competition will be inducted into the new President’s Cup Hack of Fame. While the eligibility cap will begin tracking at the conclusion of PC7, Hack of Fame induction will apply beginning with competitors from President’s Cup 1 (PC1).</p>
                                <p>Once competitors reach the eligibility cap, they are no longer eligible to place and receive awards in Individuals tracks but may continue to participate in the Teams track. To remain eligible for awards and recognition, Teams may include no more than one member that has reached the eligibility cap. This approach maintains competitive fairness while preserving opportunities for collaboration and mentorship within the team format.</p>
                                <p>Detailees to an external department can represent their home or detailed department and should seek appropriate approvals prior to participation. For example, a member of the Coast Guard detailed to DoD's US Cyber Command can represent DoD or DHS.</p>

                            <h5 class="mt-5 mb-2">Time & Challenge Submission Restrictions</h5>
                            <p>During the qualifying rounds, Individuals have 4 hours and Teams have 6 hours to complete as many challenges as they can.</p>
                            <p>The session timer runs continuously and cannot be paused once started. This applies to both Individuals and Teams. Teams should schedule their session during a time when all team members are available.</p>
                            <p>Please Note: Team Captains are the only individuals who can start the session.</p>
                            <p>A video overview of the continuous session timer is available here.</p>

                            <h5 class="mt-5 mb-2">Scoring & Partial Credit</h5>                            
                            <p>Your round score is determined by the sum of all successful challenge components completed during your session. In the event of a tie, fastest to solve methodology will be utilized. Fastest to solve is calculated by taking the timestamp of the last <b>correct</b> submission across all of the challenges in the event and subtracting it from the timestamp for when the individual or team started the event.</p>
                            <p>All President's Cup challenges have multiple parts which allow competitors to earn partial credit. Each challenge part includes the number of points awarded for providing the correct answer. Participants are limited to THREE (3) submissions per challenge.</p>
