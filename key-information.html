                         <h3 id="time-and-challenge-submission-restrictions">Time and Challenge Submission Restrictions</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>During the qualifying rounds, teams have 6 hours to complete as many challenges as they can. Individuals have 4 hours per track to solve as many challenges as they can.</li>
                                <li>The session timer runs continuously and once it is started, cannot be paused. This rule applies to both Individuals and Teams. Therefore, teams should schedule their session during a time when all team members are available.</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>PLEASE NOTE: For Teams, any team member can start the session.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <li>Your challenge timer does not stop if you "destroy" a challenge space or go work on another challenge. If you start a challenge, then start and work on another challenge, and return to your previous challenge, your challenge timer is still running.</li>
                                <li>Your round score is determined by the sum of all successful challenges completed during your session. In the event of a tiebreaker, the "Cumulative Time" figure will be used to determine who moves on to the Final Round. The Cumulative Time is the total time spent in challenges successfully solved. This is calculated using a timer specific to each challenge on your game board. When you start a challenge, the timer starts. When you successfully solve a challenge, your score and cumulative time are updated.</li>
                                <li>Correct answers will vary based on the challenge format and the questions being asked. Please refer to each challenge description which will clearly articulate the format of the answer.</li>
                                <li>The continuous session timer overview video <a href="media.html#timer-video">can be found here</a>.</li>
                            </ol>
			            <h3>Cross-Department Teams</h3>
                            <p>Teams can include participants from <em>different</em> departments and agencies, or join
                                others across the government wherever they work.</p>
                            <p>The top 33% of scores in Teams Round 1 will
                                advance to Round 2. See <a href="faq.html#q21"> FAQ #21</a></p>
                        <h3 id="team-composition">Team Composition</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Participants can only be on one team and cannot change teams during the competition. Once a team has started the competition, enrollment for the team is locked, and team members <strong>CANNOT</strong> be changed later in the competition.</li>
                                <li>Team members must be government civilian employees or military service members. Government contractors are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to participate in the President's Cup.</li>
                                <li>Teams of <strong>2 to 5</strong> members can be from any federal Executive Branch department or agency, or branch of the Armed Services.</li>
                                <li>Detailees to an external department can represent their home or detailed department. For example, a member of the Coast Guard detailed to DoD's US Cyber Command can be on a DoD or a DHS team.</li>
                                <li>Detailees should seek approval of both their home agency and detail supervisor, including agreement on which agency will be responsible for awards.</li>
                            </ol>
                        <h3>In-Person Finals Attendance</h3>

                                the <a href="mailto:presidentscup@cisa.dhs.gov">President's Cup team</a> whether they will
                                or will not attend.</p>
                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                            <p>If finalists are unable to attend, the next highest qualifying individual or team will be
                                invited. Please note
                                that entire teams will not be disqualified from participating in the Finals as long as
                                <em>at least two members</em> attend.
                            </p>
                        <h3>Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy During the In-Person Finals</h3>
                            <p>Beginning with President's Cup 6, CISA will not be supplying laptops as in previous years.
                            Therefore, all Finalists must <em>bring their own devices to use during the event.</em> This is
                            now a requirement to participate in the Finals. If you have any questions or concerns, please
                            contact the <a href="mailto:presidentscup@cisa.dhs.gov">President's Cup team</a>.</p>
                        <h3>Teams Finals</h3>
                            <p>The Teams Finals in President's Cup 6 will take place over the course of a <em>single day</em>, unlike the two-day format used in previous years. As in President's Cup 5, the Teams Finals will include an ICScape Room based upon Industrial Control Systems challenges.</p>
                        <h3>Gamespace Package Repositories</h3>
                            <p>Package repositories from the Internet have been mirrored inside the President's Cup
                                challenge environment. The current build includes Kali and Python (PyPI). If the default VM
                                for a challenge does not include a package, you can install
                                additional ones via the normal commands (<code>apt, pip</code>).</p>
