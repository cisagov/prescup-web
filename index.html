                            <li>Participants can only be on one team and cannot change teams during the competition.
                                Once a team is locked during registration, it can <strong>NOT</strong> be changed later
                                in the competition.</li>
                            <li>Teams of <strong>2 to 5 members</strong> must be from the same federal Executive Branch
                                department or agency. For example, a cross-service, joint Department of Defense team is
                                permitted as well as a Department of Justice team comprised of members from FBI, DEA,
                                and ATF. </li>
                            <li>Detailees to an external department can represent their home or detailed department. For
                                example, a member of the Coast Guard detailed to DoD's US Cyber Command can be on a DoD
                                or a DHS team. </li>
                            <li>Detailees should seek approval of both their home agency and detail
                                supervisor, including agreement on which agency will be responsible for awards.</li>
                            <li>Team members must be government civilian employees or military service members.
                                Government contractors are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to participate in the 2021
                                President's Cup. </li>

                            <li>During the qualifying rounds, teams have <strong>8 hours</strong> to complete as many
                                challenges as they can. Individuals have <strong>4 hours</strong> per track to solve as
                                many challenges as they can.</li>
                            <li>In the event of a tiebreaker, the "Cumulative Time" figure will be used to determine who
                                moves on to the Final Round. The Cumulative Time is the total time spent in challenges
                                successfully solved. This is calculated using a timer specific to each challenge on your
                                game board. When you start a challenge, the timer starts. When you successfully solve a
                                challenge, your score and cumulative time are updated.</li>
                            <li>Correct answers will vary based on the challenge format and the questions being asked.
                                Please refer to each challenge description which will clearly articulate the format of
                                the answer.</li>

                                    When a challenge is started, a timer tracks how long it takes to solve that
                                    challenge. The
                                    sum time of all successfully solved challenges is posted to the leaderboard under
                                    Cumulative Time. Again, this is for tiebreaking purposes only.</p>

                                    challenges successfully solved. This is calculated using a timer specific to each
                                    challenge on your game board. When you start a challenge, the timer starts. When you
                                    successfully solve a challenge, your score and cumulative time are updated.</p>
