                        <p>Welcome to the 2022 President's Cup Cybersecurity Competition! For those of you who competed
                            in previous years&mdash;we're glad to have you back. For those of you who are competing for
                            the first time in 2022&mdash;we're glad you joined us. Good luck to all participants, new
                            and returning.</p>
                        <p>Here are some important updates to this year's competition:</p>
                        <h3>Cross-Department Teams</h3>
                        <p>Teams can now include participants from <em>different</em> departments and agencies. Join
                            others across the government wherever they work.</p>
                        <p>With this rule change, the top scoring team from each Department will no longer automatically
                            qualify for Round 2 as in past years. Only the top 20% of scores in Teams Round 1 will
                            advance to Round 2. See <a href="#q21"> FAQ #21</a></p>
                        <h3>Gamespace Package Repositories</h3>
                        <p>Package repositories from the Internet have been mirrored inside the President's Cup
                            challenge environment. The current build includes Kali and Python (PyPI), and we are working
                            on others. If the default VM for a challenge does not include a package, you can install
                            additional ones via the normal commands (<code>apt, pip, &hellip;</code>).</p>
                        <h3>More Practice Resources</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Archive Site Available.</strong> The <a href="/archive">Archive Site</a> is
                                back! Here, players
                                can practice President's Cup challenges from past competitions as a team or as an
                                individual. All of the game cards are on the Archive Site organized by round from the
                                President's Cup 2021 competition.</li>
                            <li><strong>Open Source Updates.</strong> The <a
                                    href="https://github.com/cisagov/prescup-challenges">prescup-challenges</a> GitHub
                                project has new practice resources this year, including solution guides and challenge
                                code from 2020-2021 and <a

                                    machine builds</a> for this year.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Gameboard Improvements</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Support Inside Gameboard.</strong> <a href="/gb/support/tickets">Competition
                                    support</a> is now integrated within the Gameboard web app. Participants can create
                                support tickets from a deployed challenge or from the new <strong>Support</strong> link
                                at the top of the gameboard. The new Support link is where participants view, update, and
                                track the status of support tickets. When created from a deployed challenge, new tickets
                                already include the challenge name, support code, and game.</li>
                            <li><strong>Streamlined Registration.</strong> The registration process is streamlined to
                                include numbered steps, clearer requirements, and
                                additional instructions, making it easier for participants to register for the
                                competition.</li>
                            <li><strong>Round Completion Certificates.</strong> When each round of the competition is
                                over, participants can view and print completion
                                certificates of their achievement. Certificates will be available from the
                                <strong>Profile</strong> page in the Gameboard.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                                challenges as they can. Individuals have <strong>4 hours</strong> per track to solve

                                solve a
                                challenge, your score and cumulative time are updated.</li>

                                    When a challenge is started, a timer tracks how long it takes to solve that
                                    challenge. The

                                    challenges successfully solved. This is calculated using a timer specific to
                                    each
                                    challenge on your game board. When you start a challenge, the timer starts. When

                                    successfully solve a challenge, your score and cumulative time are updated.</p>
