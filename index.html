                        <p>Welcome to the sixth annual President's Cup Cybersecurity Competition! For those of you who
                            competed
                            in previous years&mdash;we're glad to have you back. For those of you who are competing for
                            the first time in President's Cup 6&mdash;we're glad you joined us. Good luck to all
                            participants, new
                            and returning.</p>
                        <p>Here are some important updates to this year's competition:</p>

                       
			<h3>Cross-Department Teams</h3>
                        <p>Teams can include participants from <em>different</em> departments and agencies, or join
                            others across the government wherever they work.</p>
                        <p>The top 33% of scores in Teams Round 1 will
                            advance to Round 2. See <a href="#q21"> FAQ #21</a></p>
                        <h3>In-Person Finals Attendance</h3>
                        <p>All President's Cup finalists must attend the Finals in-person in the Washington DC metropolitan
                         area in order to participate.</p>
                        <p>Upon receiving notification that they have qualified for the Finals; competitors must notify
                            the <a href="mailto:presidentscup@cisa.dhs.gov">President's Cup team</a> whether they will
                            or will not attend.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Team members must respond by February 21, 2025</li>
                            <li>Individuals must respond by March 7, 2025</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If finalists are unable to attend, the next highest qualifying individual or team will be
                            invited. Please note
                            that entire teams will not be disqualified from participating in the Finals as long as
                            <em>at least two members</em> attend.
                        </p>
			<h3>Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy During the In-Person Finals</h3>
			<p>Beginning with President's Cup 6, CISA will not be supplying laptops as in previous years.
			Therefore, all Finalists must <em>bring their own devices to use during the event.</em> This is 
			now a requirement to participate in the Finals. If you have any questions or concerns, please 
			contact the <a href="mailto:presidentscup@cisa.dhs.gov">President's Cup team</a>.</p>
			<h3>Teams Finals</h3>
			<p>The Teams Finals in President's Cup 6 will take place over the course of a <em>single day</em>, unlike the two-day format used in previous years. As in President's Cup 5, the Teams Finals will include an ICScape Room based upon Industrial Control Systems challenges.</p>
                        <h3>Gamespace Package Repositories</h3>
                        <p>Package repositories from the Internet have been mirrored inside the President's Cup
                            challenge environment. The current build includes Kali and Python (PyPI). If the default VM
                            for a challenge does not include a package, you can install
                            additional ones via the normal commands (<code>apt, pip</code>).</p>
                        <h3>Practice Resources</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Practice Area</strong> &#124; The new and improved <a href="/gb/practice"

                                past competitions. <em> Users can receive a certificate of completion after each
                                    challenge.</em></li>
                            <li><strong>Open Source Updates</strong> &#124; The <a

                                project has practice resources this year, including solution guides and challenge
                                code from all previous competitions. <a
                                    href="https://github.com/cisagov/prescup-challenges/tree/main/pc4/vm" target="_blank">Virtual

                                track the status of support tickets. When created from a deployed challenge, new tickets
                                already include the challenge name, support code, and game.</li>
                            <li><strong>Round Completion Certificates</strong> &#124; When each round of the competition is
                                over, participants can view and print <a

                                <p>The <strong>Cumulative Time</strong> column is only used for tiebreaking
                                    purposes.
                                    When a challenge is started, a timer tracks how long it takes to solve that
                                    challenge. The
                                    sum time of all successfully solved challenges is posted to the leaderboard
                                    under
                                    Cumulative Time. Again, this is for tiebreaking purposes only.</p>

                                <p>No. Once a team is established, members cannot be added. You have the option to
