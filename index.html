                            <li>Enforcement of the Rules of Conduct is at the discretion of the Competition Staff.</li>
                            <li>Competitors will conduct themselves in a manner that befits employees of the Federal
                                government and members of the Uniformed Services in all aspects of the competition.</li>
                            <li>When choosing team and individual nicknames, competitors will show decorum and refrain
                                from any names that are vulgar or political in nature (In accordance with the Hatch
                                Act). Names will go through an approval process before appearing on the leaderboard.
                                Inappropriate language, references to political persons or parties, or otherwise
                                inappropriate content will be asked to be changed. The competition aims to support
                                morale building, esprit de corps, and friendly rivalries between military units, and
                                government departments and agencies. The competition staff reserves the right to ask any
                                team or individual to change their name and maintains final judgement on what is
                                acceptable.</li>
                            <li>Classified toolsets are not authorized for use. All challenges are designed to be solved

                            <li>Any attempts at unauthorized access or “Denial of Service” attacks are forbidden and
                                will result in disqualification. “Escaping” the virtual machines or otherwise tampering
                                with or targeting the hosting environment is prohibited.</li>
                            <li>Competitors will not disclose any information involving the challenges to anyone during
                                the competition outside of their competition team.</li>

                            <li>Participants can only be on one team and cannot change teams during the competition.
                                Once a team is locked during registration, it can <strong>NOT</strong> be changed later
                                in the competition.</li>
                            <li>Teams of <strong>2 to 5 members</strong> must be from the same federal Executive Branch
                                department or agency. For example, a cross-service, joint Department of Defense team is
                                permitted as well as a Department of Justice team comprised of members from FBI, DEA,
                                and ATF. </li>
                            <li>Detailees to an external department can represent their home or detailed department. For
                                example, a member of the Coast Guard detailed to DoD's US Cyber Command can be on a DoD
                                or a DHS team. </li>
                            <li>Detailees should seek approval of both their home agency and detail
                                supervisor, including agreement on which agency will be responsible for awards.</li>
                            <li>Team members must be government civilian employees or military service members.
                                Government contractors are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to participate in the 2020
                                President's Cup. </li>

                                many challenges as they can.</li>
                            <li>In the event of a tiebreaker, the "Cumulative Time" figure will be used to determine who
                                moves on to the Final Round. The Cumulative Time is the total time spent in challenges
                                successfully solved. This is calculated using a timer specific to each challenge on your
                                game board. When you start a challenge, the timer starts. When you successfully solve a

                                    When a challenge is started, a timer tracks how long it takes to solve that
                                    challenge. The
                                    sum time of all successfully solved challenges is posted to the leaderboard under
                                    Cumulative Time. Again, this is for tiebreaking purposes only.</p>

                                    challenges successfully solved. This is calculated using a timer specific to each
                                    challenge on your game board. When you start a challenge, the timer starts. When you
                                    successfully solve a challenge, your score and cumulative time are updated.</p>

                                    individuals), can I move on to another challenge?</p>
                                <p>Yes. If you start a challenge but would like to move on to another challenge without
                                    finishing it, you can <em>DELETE</em> that gamespace. However, the challenge timer
                                    will not stop. When you return to this challenge, you can <em>RESTART</em> the
                                    gamespace
                                    in its original state.</p>

                                    automatically advances to Round 2. For the purposes of the competition, Departments
                                    align with the organizations listed during enrollment.</p>
                                <p>For those not included as top Department teams, the top 20% of remaining teams based
                                    on their final scores advance to Round 2 as well. No time-based tiebreakers are used
                                    to
                                    calculate the 15% cutoff, so all teams tied at the score cutoff will advance.</p>

                                <p>For the 2020 competition, we've implemented partial credit to reward competitor's
                                    efforts toward solving certain challenges. Partial credit challenges can have
                                    multiple <em>questions</em> and/or <em>stages</em>.</p>
                                <h5>Multiple Questions</h5>
                                <p>For challenges with more than one question, you will be presented
                                    with multiple solution submission boxes in the challenge. These
                                    challenges are designed to test your knowledge across the width of a challenge; for
                                    instance, you may be asked to provide multiple identifiers from a packet capture
                                    file, each as its own solution. The challenge will clearly identify the expected
                                    format for each partial credit solution.</p>
                                <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> When you press submit, ALL of your solutions will be
                                    sent to the grading server, and you will be limited to THREE (3) submissions per
                                    challenge. This applies whether or not you leave any submission boxes empty.</p>
                                <h5>Multiple Stages</h5>
                                <p>For challenges with more than one stage, you must correctly answer the question(s)
                                    presented in each stage before advancing to the next stage.</p>
                                <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Each stage has its own submission limit, and you will
                                    be limited to THREE (3) submissions per <em>stage</em>.</p>
